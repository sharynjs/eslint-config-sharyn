# eslint-config-sharyn

An ESLint configuration for Babel, React and Flow.

Please take a look at the [source code](https://github.com/sharynjs/eslint-config-sharyn/blob/master/index.js) to see what's included.

I am currently using TypeScript instead of Babel and Flow for my projects, so this package won't be maintained.
